# C64 Colour Changer

This is a simple online tool to change colours in a PNG image considered to be converted into something used on the Commodore C64. I lately started using [Multipaint](http://multipaint.kameli.net/) and it lacks a feature to replace one colour with another. This tool does that.

Here it is: https://codepo8.github.io/c64-colour-changer/

Tested on Safari, Edge, Firefox and Chrome.

## How to use

* Press the "load" button to upload your image. You can also paste it into the browser or drag it into the browser window.
* Click the colour you want to change using the zoom feature. Once clicked, the colour will show in the swatch next to the zoom. 
* Select a colour (or transparency) from the palette below and all the pixels in the image will change.
* If you made a mistake, hit the "undo" button
* Save the image either by clicking the save button, or copying|saving the image directly by right-clicking on it.
